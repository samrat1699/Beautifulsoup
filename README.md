Beautiful Soup is a Python library that provides a convenient way to scrape and parse HTML and XML documents. It simplifies the process of extracting data from web pages and navigating the HTML/XML tree structure.

## Features

- Parse HTML and XML documents effortlessly.
- Handle poorly formatted or malformed HTML/XML.
- Extract data using CSS selectors or regular expressions.
- Traverse and manipulate the parsed document with ease.
- Support for different types of parsers (Python built-in, lxml, html5lib).
- Works well with real-world websites with inconsistent HTML structures.

## Installation

Install Beautiful Soup using pip:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

1. Import the `BeautifulSoup` class from the `bs4` module:

   ```python
   from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
   ```

2. Create a `BeautifulSoup` object by passing the HTML/XML document and the parser:

   ```python
   # Parsing HTML
   soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')

   # Parsing XML
   soup = BeautifulSoup(xml_doc, 'xml')
   ```

3. Extract data using various methods like `find()`, `find_all()`, and CSS selectors:

   ```python
   # Find the first occurrence of a tag
   tag = soup.find('tag_name')

   # Find all occurrences of a tag
   tags = soup.find_all('tag_name')

   # Find a tag with a specific attribute value
   tag = soup.find('tag_name', attrs={'attr_name': 'attr_value'})

   # Select tags using CSS selectors
   tags = soup.select('css_selector')
   ```

4. Access tag attributes, text, or navigate the document structure:

   ```python
   # Access tag attributes
   attr_value = tag['attr_name']

   # Get the text inside a tag
   tag_text = tag.get_text()

   # Navigate the document structure
   parent_tag = tag.parent
   next_sibling = tag.next_sibling
   ```
